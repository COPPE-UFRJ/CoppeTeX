This is the README file for the CoppeTeX package.

Introduction
------------
This project provides a LaTeX document class suitable for writing
academic dissertations and thesis according to the format rules of the
Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and Research in
Engineering (Coppe/UFRJ).

The 'coppe' class contains a minimalist set of macro commands which
allows its users to create required textual elements according to the
Coppe/UFRJ dissertation/thesis guide. Among these elements, there are a
title page, cataloging details, native and foreign languages abstracts,
table of contents, and references.

Although following the Coppe/UFRJ guidelines, it can be easily ported to
standards of other institutions. This is possible due to users'
flexibility in defining textual elements required by their institutions.


When Conceived
--------------
It was conceived in january 2007, during the D.Sc. studies of Vicente Helano
and George Ainsworth at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro/COPPE.

``This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 as

Archive Content
---------------
The development of this class follows the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN) standards, so it distributes a '.ins' file, '.dtx',
and README, to assist its users during installation and use.

You should have received the following files:
  1. COPYING: full text of the GNU General Policy License version 3.

  2. Makefile: used to extract the coppe class and build the
     documentation and a sample thesis.

  3. README: describe the CoppeTeX package.

  4. coppe-unsrt.bst: unsorted BibTeX style.

  5. coppe.bib: contains the references cited in the documentation.

  6. coppe.dtx: main source file; contains the documentation, a sample
     thesis and Makeindex styles.

  7. coppe.ins: used to strip out the coppe document class from `coppe.dtx'.


Installing
----------
There is a Makefile for helping you during installation.
Try `make help`, and see what happens.
