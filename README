This is the README file for the CoppeTeX package.

Introduction
------------

This project provides a LaTeX document class suitable for writing
academic dissertations and thesis according to the format rules of the
Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and Research in
Engineering (Coppe/UFRJ).

The 'coppe' class contains a minimalist set of macro commands which
allows its users to create required textual elements according to the
Coppe/UFRJ dissertation/thesis guide. Among these elements, there are a
title page, cataloging details, native and foreign languages abstracts,
table of contents, and references.

Although following the Coppe/UFRJ guidelines, it can be easily ported to
standards of other institutions. This is possible due to users'
flexibility in defining textual elements required by their institutions.

The development of this class follows the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN) standards, i.e., it distributes a '.ins' file, '.dtx',
and README, to assist its users during installation and use.
