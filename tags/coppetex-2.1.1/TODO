Implementation
--------------

As we are trying to have a generic implementation, we should define language
options and make the Portuguese and English the default ones.

Move string definitions to other files grouped by language.  Use babel
standard: portuges.sty includes portuges.ldf.

Turning our class robust and conflict-free.  This would require rewrite it
adding a prefix to all macro command we have defined so far.

Adding Features
---------------

Now, we are living in the Natbib realm, but with fixed rules.  We need to
create a command, e.g., \biboptions{...},  so as to pass options to natbib.
It would be interesting to have the same for hyperref.
