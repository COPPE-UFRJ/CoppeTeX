This is the README file for the CoppeTeX package.

Introduction
------------

This project provides a LaTeX document class suitable for writing academic
dissertations and thesis according to the formatting rules established by the
Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering
(COPPE/UFRJ).

The 'coppe' class contains a minimalist set of macro commands which allows its
users to create the required textual elements following the COPPE/UFRJ
dissertation/thesis guidelines. Among these elements, there are a front cover,
a title page, cataloging details, native and foreign languages abstracts, table
of contents, and list of bibliographic references.

Although it is tied to the COPPE/UFRJ guidelines, it can be easily ported to
standards of other institutions. This is possible due to the code modularity.


When Conceived
--------------

It was conceived in January 2007, during the D.Sc. Studies of Vicente Helano
and George Ainsworth at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro/COPPE.


How Much
--------

``This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 as
published by the Free Software Foundation.''


Archive Content
---------------

The development of this class follows the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN) standards, so it distributes a '.ins' file, '.dtx', and
README, to assist its users during installation and use.

If you have downloaded the sources, you should have received the following
files:

  1. COPYING: full text of the GNU General Policy License version 3.

  2. Makefile: used to extract the coppe class and build the
     documentation and a sample thesis.

  3. README: describe the CoppeTeX package.

  4. coppe-unsrt.bst: unsorted BibTeX style.

  5. coppe.bib: contains the references cited in the documentation.

  6. coppe.dtx: main source file; contains the documentation, a sample
     thesis and Makeindex style.

  7. coppe.ins: used to strip out the coppe document class from `coppe.dtx'.

  8. minerva.[eps,pdf]: images included in the front cover.

A release package should contains only the following files:

  1. COPYING: full text of the GNU General Policy License version 3.

  2. README: describe the CoppeTeX package.

  3. coppe.cls: the main file. It is a LaTeX document class.

  4. coppe-unsrt.bst: unsorted BibTeX style.

  5. coppe.ist: Makeindex style for creating lists of symbols
     and abbreviations.

  6. coppe.pdf: CoppeTeX documentation.

  7. example.tex: sample thesis using coppe class.

  8. minerva.[eps, pdf]: images included in the front cover.


Installing
----------

To install CoppeTeX it is required to have any LaTeX distribution along
with the packages: doc, docstrip, ifthen, geometry, inputenc and
fontenc. The babel package is needed only to compile the sample thesis.

If you are installing from sources, there is a Makefile to properly extract the
coppe class and build its documentation and examples. If you have a make
utility, try `make help' and see what happens. Type `make class' to extract the
class and its auxiliary files. The code for the class is contained in the file
`coppe.cls'. To get the documentation, type `make doc'. This will generate the
file `coppe.dvi'. The sample thesis is compiled by running `make example'. You
can install CoppeTeX by using the command:
`make install DESTDIR=/your/local/texmf/tree'.

If you don't have any make utility, you can run `latex coppe.ins' to extract
the class together with auxiliary files. The documentation is obtained by
running `latex coppe.dtx'. The example file has to be compiled by `latex' and,
if you want to display lists of symbols or abbreviations, use the given
Makeindex style `coppe.ist'. These lists must be saved to files named
`example.syx' and `example.abx', respectively. For installing it, you can
follow the steps in the next paragraph.  You can find more details about using
the Makeindex style in the CoppeTeX users' guide.

You can still download a release package. Suppose TEXMF is a variable which
stores the path of your local LaTeX tree. Then you should copy the files
coppe.cls, coppe.ist and coppe-unsrt.bst to $TEXMF/tex/latex/coppe,
$TEXMF/makeindex/coppe and $TEXMF/bibtex/bst/coppe, respectively. In the end,
you have to type 'texhash' to update your LaTeX tree.
